# Neural Network Custom Loss Function for Flexible and High-Quality Prediction Intervals
In this project, we created a new loss function to predict intervals. This custom loss function combined with a neural network can output high-quality prediction intervals. At the same time, it can meet the requirements of different scenarios by flexibly controlling the upper and lower bounds.
